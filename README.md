# HashMap

HashMap is a small library that allow you to map hashes with style :).
It will remove from your code many of the ugly navigation inside hashes to
get your needed hash structure.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hash_map'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hash_map

## Usage

Your hash:

```ruby
{
  name: 'Artur',
  first_surname: 'hello',
  second_surname: 'world',
  address: {
    postal_code: 12345,
    country: {
      name: 'Spain',
      language: 'ES'
    }
  },
  email: 'asdf@sdfs.com',
  phone: nil
}
```

Your beautiful Mapper:

```ruby
class ProfileMapper < HashMap::Base
  property :first_name, from: :name

  property :last_name do |input|
    "#{input[:first_surname]} #{input[:second_surname]}"
  end

  property :language, from: [:address, :country, :language]

  from_child :address do
    property :code, from: :postal_code
    from_child :country do
      property :country_name, from: :name
    end
  end

  to_child :email do
    property :address, from: :email
    property :type, default: :work
  end

  property :telephone, from: :phone
end
```

Your wanted hash:

```ruby
ProfileMapper.new(original).to_h
=> {
  first_name: "Artur",
  last_name: "hello world",
  language: "ES",
  code: 12345,
  country_name: "Spain",
  email: {
    address: "asdf@sdfs.com",
    type: :work
  },
  telephone: nil
}
```

Enjoy!

### Examples:
**no from needed**
```ruby
class Clever < HashMap::Base
  property :name # will get value from the key 'name'
  property :address
end
```

**properties**
```ruby
class Properties < HashMap::Base
  properties :name, :address, :house
end
```

**blocks:**

If in **fron_child** block when you want to get the value with a block
the value of the child and original will be yielded in this order: child, original

```ruby
class Blocks < HashMap::Base
  from_child :address do
    property :street do |address|
      address[:street].upcase
    end
    property :owner do |address, original|
      original[:name]
    end
    from_child :country do
      property :country do |country|
        country[:code].upcase
      end
    end
  end
  property :name do |original|
    original[:name]
  end
end

hash = {
  name: 'name',
  address:{
    street: 'street',
    country:{
      code: 'es'
    }
  }
}

Blocks.new(hash).to_h
# => {"street"=>"STREET", "owner"=>"name", "country"=>"ES", "name"=>"name"}

```
